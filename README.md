#### (1) The Little SAS Book
A classic that just keeps getting better, The Little SAS Book is essential for anyone learning SAS programming. Lora Delwiche and Susan Slaughter offer a user-friendly approach so readers can quickly and easily learn the most commonly used features of the SAS language. Each topic is presented in a self-contained two-page layout complete with examples and graphics.

The fifth edition has been completely updated to reflect the new default output introduced with SAS 9.3. In addition, there is a now a full chapter devoted to ODS Graphics including the SGPLOT and SGPANEL procedures. Other changes include expanded coverage of linguistic sorting and a new section on concatenating macro variables with other text. This book is a great tool for users of SAS 9.4 as well.
This title belongs on every SAS programmer's bookshelf. It's a resource not just to get you started, but one you'll return to as you continue to improve your programming skills.
